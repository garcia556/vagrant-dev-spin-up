# Vagrant Spin-up

Creates a VM with Linux (Ubuntu by default) that is accessiblt directly by host-only network

## Usage
`./create.sh` will do all the work asking user for all the required input

### Prerequisites
- macOS (might work on Linux though)
- VirtualBox (I use `brew cask` version, for standalone installer `VirtualBox` provider must be used)
- Vagrant (same thing - tested on `brew cask` version)

#### macOS specific
- `gsed` (can be installed with `brew install gnu-sed`)
